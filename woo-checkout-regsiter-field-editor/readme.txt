== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it compatible with WooCommerce Checkout Blocks? =
Yes. Free supports **Text, Select, Checkbox** in Block Checkout; Classic gets **20+ field types**. [PRO](https://jcodex.com/plugins/woocommerce-custom-checkout-field-editor/) extends Block capabilities further.

= My fields aren’t showing—why? =
Confirm how your checkout page is built:
- **Classic shortcode** (`[woocommerce_checkout]`): manage fields in **Classic Checkout Fields**.
- **Block Checkout**: manage in **Blocks Checkout Fields** and ensure the **Checkout block** is used on the page.

= Can I reset to default WooCommerce checkout fields? =
Yes—use **Reset to Default** to restore the original layout in one click.

= Can I add prices/fees to fields? =
Free: no.  
PRO: yes—fixed, custom (user-entered), **% of cart**, **% of subtotal** (with/without tax), dynamic per-unit.

= Can I show custom fields on the My Account page? =
Free: checkout only.  
PRO: **Checkout + My Account** (and values persist for future orders).

= How do I add a text field to checkout? =
**WooCommerce → Checkout Form Editor → Add New Field → Text → Save.**  
Adjust label, placeholder, required, and position.

= How do I make a Select have no default? =
Add a **blank first option** (empty text & value) and optionally set a placeholder like “Select an option”.

= Will this work with any theme? =
Yes, with most well-coded themes. If a theme hard-overrides checkout templates, keep templates updated and avoid conflicting customizations.

Use **WPML, Polylang, or Loco Translate**. All strings are translation-ready.

= Does it support validation? =
Yes—**Email, Phone, Number, Postcode/State**. PRO adds custom validation options and broader controls.

Yes—activate network-wide or per site as needed.
